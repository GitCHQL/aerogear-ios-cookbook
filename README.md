AeroGear iOS Cookbook
=====================

> Recipe apps built with Xcode9

The AeroGear iOS cookbook is a list of recipes to quick start your iOS AeroGear experience.

Each recipe is a complete iOS app. The goal of the recipes is to show you how easily you can use iOS AeroGear libraries and how it helps to achieve clean code. The app features are very lean and most of UI is kept to basics in order to focus on AeroGear library usage.

Some of the demos uses a [backend](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-backend-cookbook/).

## Building and installing each app

The demos utilize [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for handling their dependencies. On the root directory of each demo, simply execute the following:

```bash
pod install
```

and then double click on the generated `.xcworkspace` to open in Xcode.
